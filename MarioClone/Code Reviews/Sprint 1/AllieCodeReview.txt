Block Objects:
I feel like all the Block classes (AbstractBlock) have an unnecessary Move() method inside. BrickPieceObject is the only class that ever uses it. 
Ideally, as block objects are capable of movement, allow Move() to handle movement logic or, at least, call onto a method that holds it. Otherwise, 
Move() is just clutter atm.

Variables:
It doesn't look like any of the object variables in the main class follow any kind of pattern. Half of the object variables are Pascal casing, 
others use camal casing. Ideally, all of these objects should have camal casing (redKoopa, goomba, greenKoopa, brickBlock, fireFlower). 

IController:
As both keyboardController and gamepadController implement IController in some fashion, maybe they're initialized as IControllers instead of 
keyboardController & gamepadController. 

IController keyBoard = new KeyboardController();
List<IController> gamepads = new List<IController>();

vs.

KeyboardController keyBoard = new KeyboardController();
List<GamepadController> gamepads = new List<GamepadController>();

File Under Review: KoopaObject.cs

Comments on Code Quality:

As of right now, the Koopa object has the ability to only return Green Koopas. Upon creation of a 'Red Koopa' in the main class, it uses 
KoopaObject - which has no ability to return red. 

Either we make two objects, RedKoopa and GreenKoopa, or create some sort of way to let the KoopaObject know which Koopa to make. 
Since both Red and Green Koopas (as far as I can see), have the same behavior, having two seperate objects is a bit redundant. 
The most trivial solution to this seems to be passing in some argument into KoopaObject that determines if red or green is made. 

If Red and Green Koopas do behave differently later, having seperate objects would work better. 

//Seems this was already fixed//
