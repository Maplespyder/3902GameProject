After adding in multipler game mode, I feel that having certain keys statically mapped to one player where we hard code it in is not the best
way to do it. Maybe it would be better if the game took input from two keyboards instead of one so that it could help alleviate this problem 
and also make it easier to play the game with two people.

So in each of these update methods, we have repetitive code where we are generating a random byte from 1-190 and modding it by 2.
I think instead of repeating this code we could have made a method in the abstract class that returns 1 or 0 and just call that method 
instead to be more efficient.
