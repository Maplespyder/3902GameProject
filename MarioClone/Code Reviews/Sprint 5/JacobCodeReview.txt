Comments on Code Quality:

Overall I like this class, it follows the already existing template for the states. It sets up everything it needs in the Enter method, and cleans up in the Leave method
as it should. It seems to miss the point of overriding the colllision response, though. I'm not sure if the intent was to only stop when colliding on left and right, because
by calling base.CollisionResponse(), it does have the potential to exit the method through those means, even though they aren't in the derived.
I like the simple workaround of action state not actually updating (which may have been an oversight in my part), by just defining a getter that determines when it's over.
Then, the state only has to be concerned with sending Mario flying, and the StateMachine actually handles exiting dash.


Minutes to Complete: 10 min
Hypothetical Change to File:
We want Mario to blast through blocks when he dashes.
All we would have to do is change the collision override to not respond to whatever kinds of blocks we want to break (of course, those blocks would also 
want to choose to break). Then, just remove the call to base.CollisionResponse(). That's a kind of radical change, but it would be very easy to implement with this class.
