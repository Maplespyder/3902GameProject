Comments on Code Quality:

Looking specifically on FixClipping and CollisionResponse. I think this is fairly clean, but I am not sure if clipping should be fixed specifically on this level
for Mushrooms. I think a lot of powerups can have the same clipping cases and can be handled in some sort of parent class. I think we need to change the draw order
on this class, because a lot of the time I can see the mushroom clip in front of and behind the same object multiple times, which is definitely not intended.
The collision response is a little messy, since a lot of the if statements seem to be tackling specific bugs that aren't apparent just from looking at the function.
We should change it to make more sense from a quick glance.

Hypothetical Change to File:
We probably need to start moving stuff to constants elsewhere, because the specific values are getting a little messy.
