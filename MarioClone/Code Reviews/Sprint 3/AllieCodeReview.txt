All properties that are solely used in this class should really be set to private.

Comments on Code Quality:
There are instances of magic numbers lying around in BecomeSuper() BecomeNormal() and BecomeFire().
For someone who isn't familiar with the code, this can be very confusing. I understand now these 
numbers are being used (primarily in the X direction) to prevent shifting between states. 

For clarity (and considering we're still using them), these numbers should be put into variables.

Comments on Code Quality:
In this file, three constants, KoopaHeight, GoombaHeight and MarioHeight are defined. However, this doesn't allow much flexibility if, 
for whatever instance, sprite sheets  were to change or sizes of individual sprites were altered. It's fairly prone to error 
and problems. 

Instead of manually tapping in those numbers. It'd be cleaner if, after initiliazing each object, you edit the Position and add in the 
height via Sprite.SourceRectangle.Height. That way, if Koopas or such were to ever change, there would be less code that need be 
refactored.
