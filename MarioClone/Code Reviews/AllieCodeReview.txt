WhenCollisionCheck::
Though I wrote the WhenCollisionCheck, after reviewing over the final version, 
I believe I can clean up this method. First and foremost, the WhenCollisionCheck 
not only does a 'When' check, but also manages to do 'Where', as well. The method, 
if possible, should be renamed to WhenAndWhereCheck, to account for this method's
abilities. 

Second, the WhenCollisionCheck is a long method. With several blocks of if statements,
I might be able to minimize the length by moving blocks of code into different methods. 
That being said, I believe the section that checks 'where' can be moved to a seperate 
method to make the code more manageable. 

CollisionCheck::
Originally, this method had a lot more meat to it but it was simplified with Rectangle's 
intersect method. Now, this method has literally one line of code and, no doubt, it's 
taking up more room than need be. If we could, we should get rid of this method, and 
replace the call to this method with the line of code, instead.  

In General::
I think most of the established properties at the top of the method can have their
access rights changed from public to private, as many are only used within this
very class.
