Comments on Code Quality:

So the code that was added to check when to swtich to the winning game state I think should be handled differently. Currently it is not making use of the FlagPoleHit event, 
and is just changing states within the collision repsonse method for mario when he hits the pole. What would be better is if there was a method within the main game class that subscribed 
to the Flagpole hit event and when it triggers then we can return a boolean that will be set to true. Then in marioclone's update method we could check to see if that boolean is true and if it is then we 
can stop updating the game and drawing sprites and enter the winning game state.
