Comments on Code Quality:

The MuteCommand method problably could've been handled more gracefully and with less lines of code. In general, Muted could be an integer and then
volume could be multiplied by it, so then we would save a few lines of code. PoolList should probably be a set instead of a list, since there shouldn't
be two of the same sound at once in there. I'm not really sure why in InitializeSoundPool there are 2 coin and 1 fireball sounds added. It seems pretty
obfuscated at this point, but I'm sure it's there for a good reason. This seems like a good class since the methods all have a distinct purpose, and this
can be used for many different situations.

Hypothetical Change to File:

I'd be curious to see how it changes if we require that sounds stop when Mario dies.
