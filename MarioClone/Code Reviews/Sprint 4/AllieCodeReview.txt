The Draw() method in this class is starting to lean on the lengthier side. Though
I don't suggest any changes with the logic, we could move code from 313 to  353 to its
own method (maybe FadeToBlack or such), so it becomes cleaner.

I think the way the background was handled could of been done a lot better. 
For starters, the sprites are hardcoded in, no matter what kind of level is
being created. I think, via the level creator, in some fashion, we should
decide what kind of backdrop we'd like. 

IE: A pink block in the corner might mean we'd want to load in one set of
parallaxing backgrounds versus another. Although I'm sure there's a better 
way to handle it beyond that, it's just an idea.
