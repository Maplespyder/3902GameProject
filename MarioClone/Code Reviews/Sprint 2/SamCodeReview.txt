Comments on Code Quality:
Code quality is generally good. The problems were implemented in a good way, but I feel that the file is very disorganized.
There are lots of methods that do different things and it's a little hard to tell where each method would be called, at least
without going through all the code.

This is an issue we're currently struggling with, but I would like to think of ways to avoid the problem where Mario can just
scoot through walls and places he shouldn't be able to get through by just spamming the movement button a bunch. A preliminary
idea I have to solve that is to push Mario back a little bit whenever he collides with blocks, in order to make sure he can't
get through them.

Comments on Code Quality:
I think this is a good start for the tile map definition, but I'd like to see some more detail on the individual colors.
It was a little confusing at first, because the code uses Argb values but this definition only provided RGB values. Also,
it would also be beneficial to provide the hex codes for each of the colors.

Hypothetical Change to File:
In the future, we will have to represent a single block that could have different items in it, such as coins or mushrooms.
Currently, we have no way of doing this. I think a good way to solve this would be to have an R value unique to each type
of block that has coins or mushrooms. Then, there would be two G values, one representing powerups or nothing, and one 
representing an amount of coins. Then the B value would be used to determine what type of powerup or how many coins exist
within the block.
